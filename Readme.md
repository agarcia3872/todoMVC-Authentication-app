This project will be a to-do / reminder application. Since I'm always forgetting things that I have to do I decided to create an app to help me remember tasks that I need to accomplish and by when they need to be completed. The user will be able to create an account and login to it. Add tasks , set time to complete by, and mark wether task was completed.
